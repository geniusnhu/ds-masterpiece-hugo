      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Have you ever wondered why you, a talented Data Scientist, is not considered as an adviser or a consultant for business, but just a normal employee?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is such a common complaint I heard so many times from my friends, especially the junior. I have also struggled with this issue during the first year of my career but then I successfully overcame it. Now, I realized that this is a real &lt;strong&gt;bottleneck&lt;/strong&gt; of Data Scientist and I think I should share my experience to others so that it will help other Data Scientist achieving a higher reputation for their career.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This problem does not only exist in some certain areas but appears everywhere, especially when the scale is tilted toward technical skills rather than keeping balance between &lt;strong&gt;business mindset&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;technical models&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even for some senior Data Scientists, this issue is a headache. When I meet others, we spent most of the time talking about a Machine learning models such as RNN, NLP, or advanced and new achievement in applying Data science in the company. However, if I ask them why they decided to use RNN instead of Deep learning and how their model supports the business, they could hardly provide a persuasive reason or they would go with a lengthy explanation on concept, algorithm but forget business aspect.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I totally do not deny the integral role of technical work of a data scientist, I only want to emphasize the importance of &lt;em&gt;understanding the business concept at first before any other activities&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hence, I wonder whether they really understand how their models contribute to the business.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here I list out a standard flow for starting a data science projects with key point to pay attention to. which I has been applying throughout 4 years working for 2 multinational companies as a data analyst and data scientist.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As mentioned above, this post is written based on my experience. Therefore, adjust them to your own situation, and always remember the key concepts so that you will find the most suitable approach for your own work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;1-first-and-foremost-importance---clarifying-business-question&#34;&gt;1. First and foremost importance - Clarifying Business question&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During my years in analytics and data science, in addition to technological concept explanation, &lt;strong&gt;business question clarification&lt;/strong&gt; is one of the most difficult tasks when a Data scientist communicates with business partner.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am sure that you here this everywhere, in many articles, that you will always have to clarify business question.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;But how?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Working is different with researching, especially a Data Scientist is expected to become a wise man who knows the answer for all questions within the business or at least knows how to get the right answers. Therefore, digging the problem is our job and how to do that is our responsibility.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It must be very familiar with you when a sales manager asks you &lt;em&gt;&amp;ldquo;I want to know why sales declined?&amp;quot;&lt;/em&gt; or a marketing director: &lt;em&gt;&amp;ldquo;How to increase the efficiency of the promotion activity for brand A on our website?&amp;quot;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you hear these questions, can you imagine the right approach or the answer to the case? Or you will be very vague and keep asking yourself &lt;em&gt;&amp;ldquo;Is that they want me to do this.&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;I think they want to know that.&amp;quot;&lt;/em&gt;, and if you deliver the result based on this understanding, &lt;strong&gt;how much confidence you have on your result?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The only one response you will get from them is:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&amp;ldquo;This is not what I need&amp;rdquo;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;OMG! How terrible it is when you spent so much effort into this, but no one values it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;This is because you did not truly understand problem so that you did not touch the right pain point!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I know that the common advice is to ask &lt;em&gt;&amp;ldquo;Why&amp;rdquo;&lt;/em&gt; in order to dig into the real problems. However, this solution is not applicable all times because the business partners might not know why for all of your questions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I usually start by asking about the &lt;strong&gt;background of the question&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;why and how they come up with the request&lt;/strong&gt;. This is not because I do not understand the business performance but I want to be on the same page with requester and to be able to advise them further on. After asking, many times you will see that the way to deal with the real problem should be different. For example, for the question &lt;em&gt;&amp;ldquo;How to increase the efficiency of the promotion activity for brand A during summer?&amp;quot;&lt;/em&gt;, the real issue is not to improve the efficacy of the activity but to optimize the budget spending on online promotion in order to increase the purchase rate and new customers. This is the real question that your business partner wants you to help them answer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then, discuss with the business partner, truly understand on the problem, get alignment on delivery deadline or anything related.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Be a thinker, not a doer!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;2-identify-the-approach-for-the-problem&#34;&gt;2. Identify the approach for the problem&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This part is to set the methodology for the analysis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This step requires a broad knowledge on either &lt;strong&gt;statistical models&lt;/strong&gt; or &lt;strong&gt;machine learning&lt;/strong&gt; approached. In some companies, especially non-tech savvy ones, a data scientist is in charge of both analytics and data science work stream.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are numerous models, analysis approaches that you have already learnt and sometimes you will get lost in whether using which types of descriptive analysis, which models of predictive analysis, classification, segmentation, time series forecasting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;For example: Linear Regression cannot be used to segment customers or Descriptive analysis cannot predict customer churn.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This step seems to be easy but in fact drives you crazy and confused. If the Sales Director asked Data Science team to forecast the &lt;strong&gt;sales for next year&lt;/strong&gt;, and the business need is to get the forecast &lt;strong&gt;based on the amount of budget spending&lt;/strong&gt;, then which model should be used?
If the business wanted the forecast &lt;strong&gt;based on the market movement&lt;/strong&gt;, which approach is suitable?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is the importance in choosing the right approach for the business question.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;3-acquire-the-appropriate-data&#34;&gt;3. Acquire the appropriate data&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After identifying the business questions and the approach above, set up data requirement and extract the appropriate data from the data warehouse are the next thing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Data selection sounds to be straightforward but indeed complicated. To solve the business questions, which kind of data is in need of. For example, will it need to have the birthday information of the customer if the task is to predict their churn probability?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then, identify the approach to acquire the data. This can be from company&#39;s data warehouse, conducting survey collecting result, or government-owned data&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;However, what occurs during Data Collection?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are two major problems in this step&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The unavailability of data&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The bias of training data&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, let&#39;s look at the &lt;strong&gt;unavailability of data&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This problem is very common in real case in which data is unable to capture at the moment of collection such as &lt;em&gt;the time spent in using a non-digital product&lt;/em&gt;. As a common sense, you will think that you have to get the data. However, you have to consider the consequences of getting data including cost, time, resources and if the data is indeed not too important to your model, all the effort you put into it will be down the drain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Therefore, the solution for this case is to defer inaccessible data and in case the model requires this data for a better result, you will have more resources and confident to invest in obtaining it in the future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, one of the provident ways of getting new features is to change the system of collecting data to acquire the right information needed. The Data scientist team can discuss with data management to get the timestamp that customers log on the page in addition to the browsing/ purchasing data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If the Data scientist is unable to acquire unavailable data through the above way, then think about contacting an outside data owner and prepare the budget.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Second, the &lt;strong&gt;bias of data&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This problem is serious especially &lt;strong&gt;when the training set gets bias from the beginning, the model will learnt accordingly to that bias and results into an inaccuracy prediction&lt;/strong&gt; when comparing to the real world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the most famous flaws of bias in data is the Amazon recruiting AI tool that showed bias against women. The tool reviewed candidate&#39;s resumes in order to pick the top talents within them. The tool showed an obvious bias against women because its training data is not gender-neutral from the beginning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Therefore, at first hand, be careful with data and its natural distribution are critical responsibility of every Data Scientist.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After getting all the data you need, the next step is thing that a Data scientist usually does:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;DS_Flow.jpg&#34;
style=&#34;float: left; margin-right: 10px;&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The order can be flexible and this is the standard progress that I usually do in my project and my job. Sometimes, after tuning and the accuracy does not meet my expectation, I need to go back to the feature engineering step to find other way to deal with features.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These are the key bottlenecks beside the technical skills that I want to head up for Data Scientist who want to become more than just a Data insight extractor.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Quick deep dive at Data Scientist Skill set</title>
      <link>/2020/01/17/quick-deep-dive-at-data-scientist-skill-set/</link>
      <pubDate>Fri, 17 Jan 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>/2020/01/17/quick-deep-dive-at-data-scientist-skill-set/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;One year ago, when I truly and seriously considered improving my skill in Data Science, two questions were always lingering in my mind:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What truly are the skills that a Data Scientist needs?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What skill will support me in the future and How do I improve myself in the right direction at the most efficacy?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And many other friends, acquaintances reached out to me for a thought of what to learn to become a Data Scientist.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Actually, I can share some of my experiences with them, but as you&#39;ve already known, this field evolves unpreceedingly fast, technology and new required skills change on the yearly basis at the slowest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;What you learn today will be the old of tomorrow!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Luckily, when I was known of the Kaggle dataset on Survey of Data Science and Machine learning, this data will definitely give me some insights for my questions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Data source is &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.kaggle.com/c/kaggle-survey-2019&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this post, I will summary my key findings from the survey. The complete analysis can be found through this &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.kaggle.com/geninhu/direction-toward-a-great-data-scientist/data&#34;&gt;link&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This analysis uses R language with tidyverse package for the best insight visualization.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before looking at the result, below are the data cleaning and preparation for the analysis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Feature selection:&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This dataset includes the written answer of the respondents if they picked &lt;code&gt;&amp;quot;Other&amp;quot;&lt;/code&gt; choice for some questions. However, the written answers are stored in another &lt;em&gt;csv&lt;/em&gt; file so that all the variables containing &lt;code&gt;&amp;quot;Other&amp;quot;&lt;/code&gt; will not a valuable variable for the analysis, therefore they will be excluded from the dataset.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For this analysis, the &lt;code&gt;&amp;quot;Duration&amp;quot;&lt;/code&gt; variable is not the factor that I want to explore so it will be excluded as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;ol start=&#34;2&#34;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Other data cleaning:&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shorten some typical column names for easier understanding.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Set level for values in the variables that require level later on, such as &lt;em&gt;Company size, Compensation/Salary, year of experience with machine learning&lt;/em&gt;&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;ol start=&#34;3&#34;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Create functions for plotting (Example is as below)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-python&#34;&gt;plot_df_ds &amp;lt;- function (df_draw_ds, columnName1, columnName2) {
    names(df_draw_ds)[columnName1] &amp;lt;- paste(&amp;quot;value&amp;quot;)
    names(df_draw_ds)[columnName2] &amp;lt;- paste(&amp;quot;value2&amp;quot;)
    df_draw_ds &amp;lt;- df_draw_ds %&amp;gt;% 
    select (value, value2) %&amp;gt;%
    group_by(value, value2) %&amp;gt;%
    filter(value != &amp;quot;Not employed&amp;quot;,value != &amp;quot;Other&amp;quot;) %&amp;gt;% 
    summarise(count=n()) %&amp;gt;% 
    mutate(perc= prop.table(count))
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, let&#39;s explore the result.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;role-and-responsibilities&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Role and Responsibilities:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A Data scientist&amp;rsquo; is &amp;lsquo;s responsibility for many tasks with top 3 are:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Analyzing data&lt;/strong&gt; to influence product or to support business decisions&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Explore new areas of Machine learning&lt;/strong&gt; through builidng prototypes&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Experiment to &lt;strong&gt;improve company existing Machine learning models&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/geniusnhu/ds-masterpiece-hugo/master/content/post/2020-01-17-quick-deep-dive-at-data-scientist-skill-set/responsibility.png&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;programming-skills&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Programming skills:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Python, SQL and R&lt;/strong&gt; are all the programming languages that are essential for Data Scientist as they stand in the Top 3 respectively.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/geniusnhu/ds-masterpiece-hugo/master/content/post/2020-01-17-quick-deep-dive-at-data-scientist-skill-set/PL.png&#34; width=&#34;300&#34; height=&#34;450&#34; &gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;machine-learning-skills&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Machine Learning skills:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is not a surprise if all Data Scientists use Machine Learning in their daily job but I was amazed that almost all of them use both Natural Language Processing and Computer Vision. These 2 fields has no longer been specified areas to some groups of users but expanded to much wider application and require Data Scientist to own these skills.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;machine-learning-algorithm-skills&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Machine Learning algorithm skills:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Regression&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;Tree-based algorithms&lt;/strong&gt; are the models used by Data Scientist. With the long history in statistics and analytics, these models are still being favor in analyzing data. Another advantage of these traditional models is that they are easy to explain to business partner. Other models such as Neuron network, or Deep learning is hard to explain the result.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/geniusnhu/ds-masterpiece-hugo/master/content/post/2020-01-17-quick-deep-dive-at-data-scientist-skill-set/ML.png&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another interesting thing is that 51% of Data scientists is applying &lt;strong&gt;Boosting method&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;python-skills&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Python skills:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Scikit-learn, Keras, Xgboost, TensorFlow and RandomForest libraries&lt;/strong&gt; are the top used frameworks given their benefit and convenience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/geniusnhu/ds-masterpiece-hugo/master/content/post/2020-01-17-quick-deep-dive-at-data-scientist-skill-set/package.png&#34; width=&#34;300&#34; height=&#34;450&#34;&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;data-scientist-credential&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Data Scientist Credential:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Foundation skills&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Writing code is an important skill of a good Data scientist. You do not need to be an excellent coder to be a Data scientist but it is dangerous to think that knowing little of coding skill is just enough to work as a Data scientist.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is essential to build up your business skills in addition to technical skills. Many data scientists, especially the junior excels at machine learning and coding but is lack of a business point of view so that most of their work does not support the business as the way it should be. Their recommendations were far from what the company is doing and it ended up beating all of their effort. That is the worst thing you want to face in the world of Data science when no one thinks your idea valuable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Specialized skills&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Familiar with and expert in Python, SQL and/or R on various online/offline platforms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fluency in using Local development environments and Intergrated development Environment, including but not limited to Jupyter, RStudio, Pycharm. Try to &lt;strong&gt;learn on job&lt;/strong&gt; or &lt;strong&gt;learn on practice&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Strong foundation with practical experience in Linear/Logistics regression, Decision Tree/Random Forest, and Gradient Boosting models. Moreover, besides popular and must known libraries such as Scikit-learn, Keras, Tensorflow, Xgboost is the framework that student should learn at the moment. Working on your own project/cooperating project is a good choice to get practical experience if you have not obtained the chance in a company.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Computer Vision and NLP are the booming areas in Data science so it is beneficial to prepare yourself with these skills.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although AutoML is a newly emerging field, it will probably become one of the important tools and skills for Data Scientist, including Automated hyperparameter tuning, Data augmentation, Feature engineering/selection and Auto ML pipelines.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Skills in working with Big data and Big data products e.g Google Bigquerry, Databricks, Redshift are the must to own.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is the same with usage of cloud computing skills. In big company, it is a common to work on cloud so if you do not know how to conduct machine learning on cloud, it will become your minus comparing to other candidates.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And one last important thing: &lt;strong&gt;Always believe in yourself, your choice and never give up&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;end-notes&#34;&gt;End notes&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As the big survey focusing on the Data science / Machine Learning areas, it appeared as a great source for me to gain valuable information.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Beside understanding which typical skills requiring to advance in the Data Science field, I want to turn the dataset into a Salary prediction model and I will update on that in upcoming days.&lt;/p&gt;
